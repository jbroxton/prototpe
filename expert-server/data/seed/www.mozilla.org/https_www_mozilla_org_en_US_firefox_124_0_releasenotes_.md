*   In Firefox View, open tabs can now be sorted by either recent activity or tab order. Recent activity is the default setting.
    
*   Firefox now populates the Windows taskbar jump list more efficiently, which should allow for a smoother overall browsing experience.
    
*   Firefox on Mac now uses the macOS fullscreen API for all types of fullscreen windows. This should better match the expected macOS user experience for fullscreen spaces, menubar and the Dock.
    
*   As of Firefox 124, Qwant's availability has been expanded to all languages in the France region along with Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
