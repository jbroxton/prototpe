Version 131.0, first offered to Release channel users on October 1, 2024

*   Firefox will now offer to temporarily remember when users grant permissions to sites (e.g. geolocation). Temporary permissions will be removed either after one hour or when the tab is closed.

*   A tab preview is now displayed when hovering the mouse over background tabs, making it easier to locate the desired tab without needing to switch tabs.

*   When suggesting a default translation language, Firefox will now take into consideration languages you have previously used for translations.
    
*   Weâ€™ve re-introduced the ability to navigate to the search engine home page when the search bar is empty by using `shift`\-`enter`/`shift`\-`click`.
    

*   The following language is now supported by Firefox [translation](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/features/translate/):
    
    *   Swedish
    

*   You can find information about policy updates and enterprise specific bug fixes in the [Firefox for Enterprise 131 Release Notes](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/firefox-enterprise-131-release-notes).
    

*   As part of the ongoing updates to SVG 2, `SVGGraphicsElement.nearestViewportElement` and `SVGGraphicsElement.farthestViewportElement` have been officially removed. Please note that these properties have had deprecation warnings since February.
    
*   Firefox now supports text fragments, which allows users to link directly to a specific portion of text in a web document via a special URL fragment. ([Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Fragment/Text_fragments))
    
*   Firefox improved HiDPI support for Linux users by now fully respecting Gnome 3/GTK3 font scaling settings, creating a more consistent user interface experience on high-resolution displays.
    

*   `SameSite=None` cookies will now be rejected when there is no `Secure` attribute included.
    
*   Support for Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State (CHIPS) was now added, allowing developers to opt a cookie into storage partitioned per top-level site. ([Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Privacy_sandbox/Partitioned_cookies))
    

*   For Firefox users experiencing an error in the BillPay section of their bank's website, we're aware of the issue, and a fix is coming soon. In the meantime, to work around this, you may set your ETP to standard protection. Here's how to do that: [https://mzl.la/4dFrcNw](https://mzl.la/4dFrcNw)

*   Windows users with Avast or AVG security software may experience a crash when visiting certain sites.
    
*   For Firefox users experiencing issues using Google authentication and being prompted to `clear cookies and site data` when attempting to login, we're aware of the issue, and a fix is coming soon. In the meantime, to work around this, browse to [google.com](https://google.com/) and then `clear cookies and site data`.
