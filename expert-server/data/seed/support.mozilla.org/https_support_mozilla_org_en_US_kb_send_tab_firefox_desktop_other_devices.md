Firefox's Send Tab feature lets you send pages from your computer to other devices, such as an iPhone, iPad or Android device.

**Note:** _Other devices_ can also mean [Firefox profiles](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-remove-switch-firefox-profiles) on the same computer, if you use more than one Firefox version or profile.
