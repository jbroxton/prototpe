A Primary Password adds an extra layer of security to Firefox by protecting your saved logins. Even if someone gains access to your device, they won’t be able to view or use your stored passwords without entering your Primary Password. This ensures that your most sensitive information—such as banking and email credentials—remains protected from unauthorized access.

If you share a computer with anyone, it is strongly recommended that you use a Primary Password.

**Multiple devices/profiles:** Primary Passwords are set locally and are not synced between [profiles](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data) or devices. If you use more than one device or profile, those use separate Primary Passwords.

*   For other privacy issues related to sharing a computer, see [How do I share Firefox between people on a computer?](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-share-firefox-between-people-on-computer)

**Important:** After you have defined and set your Primary Password, you will be prompted to enter it once for each Firefox session, when Firefox needs access to your stored passwords. This also applies if you want to add, remove or show a password.

## Create a Primary Password

By default, Firefox does not use Primary Passwords (formerly known as Master password) to protect stored credentials. To define a Primary Password:

1.  Click the menu button ![Fx89menuButton](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2021-05-15-11-18-38-e5b736.png) to open the menu panel.
2.  Click .
3.  Click the Firefox logins menu ![Three dot menu](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2024-01-22-10-49-58-d6b929.png), then click .
    
    ![Firefox logins menu](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2024-01-22-10-47-55-d6f303.png)![Fx122 WIN 3 Dot Menu Options](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2024-01-23-09-53-26-dc4138.png)
    
    *   The Firefox Settings panel will open to the **Logins and Passwords****Passwords** section.
    
    ![FxSettingsPrimaryPasswordSimplified](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2025-06-09-15-49-45-4859b3.png)
    
4.  Put a checkmark next to **Use a Primary Password** to open the **Change Primary Password** dialog.
5.  Enter your Primary Password. The Password quality meter will indicate the difficulty of guessing your defined password. To create a quality password, your Primary Password should include the following:
    
    *   At least one uppercase letter to add complexity.
    *   Digits embedded within the password, avoiding simple placements at the start or end.
    *   At least one non-alphanumeric character, such as: @ # $ % ^ & \* ( ).
    *   A configuration that is easy for you to remember but difficult for others to guess, ensuring that you, and only you, can access this secure information.
    
    For more information on choosing passwords, see [Choose a strong password](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-strength).
    
    **Tip:** Avoid common substitutions or sequences that might seem complex but are widely used and easily guessed, such as "Password1!" or "Password@13". Instead, think of a unique phrase or a combination of words that only you can easily recall.
    
6.  Enter the password a second time to confirm that you have entered it consistently.

## Remove the Primary Password

Should you decide you don't need your Primary Password anymore, you can delete it at any time:
