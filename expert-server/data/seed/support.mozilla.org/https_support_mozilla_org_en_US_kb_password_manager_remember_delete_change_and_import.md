Firefox securely stores your usernames and passwords for accessing websites, automatically fills them in for you the next time you visit a website, and lets you manage your stored logins with its built-in password management feature. This article will show you how to remember, view, edit, manage, remove and protect your logins in Firefox and also how to disable this feature.

*   To get your passwords everywhere you use Firefox, [turn on Sync](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-set-sync-my-computer).

**Note:** On macOS and Windows, OS authentication may be required when accessing stored passwords using , or ![IG eye](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2024-06-11-10-53-34-8c3fa8.png) (the reveal button, represented by an eye icon). This is **not** your Mozilla account credentials. See [Secure Firefox passwords with device sign-in](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-password-authentification-prompt) for more information.

## Make Firefox remember usernames and passwords

When you enter a username and password that you haven't already saved for a website, Firefox will ask if you want to save it.

![FF70 Password](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2019-10-06-21-03-14-92afab.png)

**Tip:** Clicking outside of the Save prompt will hide it. To bring it back, just click the key icon on the left side of the address bar. If Firefox does not prompt you to save passwords, see [Usernames and passwords are not saved](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/usernames-and-passwords-are-not-saved).

In the prompt:

*   **To have Firefox remember your username and password**, click on Save. The next time you visit the website, Firefox will automatically enter your username and password for you.
    *   If you've stored the wrong username or password, just type the right one into the website and Firefox will prompt you to save it. To save the new username and password, click on Update.
*   **To tell Firefox to never remember usernames and passwords for the current website**, click the drop-down menu and select . In the future, when you log in to the website, you won't be prompted to save the username and password.
    *   If you later change your mind and would like Firefox to ask you to save usernames and passwords for this site, you'll need to go into your Firefox Settings and remove the site's entry from the panel _Exceptions_ list.
*   **To skip saving your username and password this time**, click Don't Save. You'll be prompted to save your username and password the next time you visit the site.

**Note:** Some websites offer to keep you logged in by clicking a checkbox on the site. This is a feature of the website and will work whether or not you have saved your username and password in Firefox.

You can also [manually add website logins](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-login-firefox-password-manager). Click the menu ![Fx89menuButton](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2021-05-15-11-18-38-e5b736.png) button, select , click Create New Login at the bottom the + next to the _Search Logins_ _Search Passwords_ box at the top left, add a website address, username and password, and click Save.

## Managing multiple accounts for a site

If you have more than one account for a site, Firefox can save all your logins. Each time you log in to a site, you can choose the login information you would like Firefox to use.

**Add another login account:** To save an additional login for a site, enter the login credentials and click **Save** when prompted. Use the drop-down arrow to see a list of saved usernames for that site. You can also start typing to narrow the results.  
![Fx81AddLogins](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2020-09-16-15-48-15-ad973c.png)

If more than one login is stored for a website, the list of usernames will appear when you click the login field. Select the username you want to log in with.

![SavedLoginsFx81](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2020-09-16-15-31-30-ffa911.png)

**To view passwords for a specific site**, click the username field for that site, then click View Saved Logins (see above).

## Managing usernames and passwords

1.  Click the menu button ![Fx89menuButton](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2021-05-15-11-18-38-e5b736.png) to open the menu panel.
2.  Click . The Firefox _about:logins_ page will open in a new tab.
    
    ![Fx115AboutLogins](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2023-10-10-05-20-14-5cf011.png)![Fx122AboutLogins](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2024-01-24-19-45-03-e0f37b.png)
    

From here, you can view, copy, edit or remove your saved logins.

**Note:** You can enter a site, username, or password in the _Search Logins__Search Passwords_ text box, to filter the logins listed on the left.

After you select an entry from the list of logins, you can perform these actions:

*   Click Copy to copy a username or password.
*   Click ![FF70 Unhide Password](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2019-10-06-21-22-05-57ecea.png) to see the password.
*   Click Edit to change the username or password.
*   Click Remove to remove the login from Firefox.

See [Edit or delete a login with the Firefox Password Manager](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/edit-or-delete-login-firefox-password-manager) for more information.

## Exporting login and password data

If you want to back up your saved usernames and passwords or move them to a different application, you can export this data to a `.csv` (comma separated values) file. See [Export login data from Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/export-login-data-firefox) for more information.

## Protecting your passwords

If you use the same simple password for everything, you will be more susceptible to [identity theft](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft). The [Choose a strong password](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-strength) article shows you an easy method for creating secure passwords and managing your passwords, as described above, to help you remember them all.

Even though Firefox stores your usernames and passwords on your computer in an [encrypted](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Encrypted) format, someone with access to your computer user profile can still see or use them. The [Use a Primary Password to protect stored logins and passwords](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-primary-password-protect-stored-logins) article shows you how to prevent this and keep you protected in the event your computer is lost or stolen.

## Disable the Firefox password management feature

Firefox offers to remember usernames and passwords by default. To change your settings:

**Note:** If the **Ask to save logins and passwords for websites****Ask to save passwords** setting is greyed out, Firefox may be set to never remember history or to always use [private browsing mode](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/private-browsing-use-firefox-without-history). To restore normal browsing, go to your settings under _History_ and remove the check mark next to **Always use private browsing mode**, or select **Remember history** from the drop-down menu, and then restart Firefox.
