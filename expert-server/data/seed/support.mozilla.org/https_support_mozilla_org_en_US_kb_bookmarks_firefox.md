## How to use keywords with bookmarks

You can use _keywords_ to easily access your bookmarks. When you assign a keyword to a bookmark, you can simply type the keyword into the address bar and press EnterReturn to open the bookmark. Any words supplied _after_ the bookmark keyword and a space will be URL-encoded and substituted into the bookmark's URL in place of the `%s` placeholder, wherever that appears; see below for details.

To assign a keyword to a bookmark:

1.  Open the [Library window](#w_how-do-i-organize-my-bookmarks) and select the bookmark.
2.  Click the keyword field at the bottom of the window.
3.  Type your desired keyword.
    *   The keyword may contain letters, digits and special characters (for example: `- _ ' " , . : ; = / \ ( ) [ ] { } ! & @ ~`). It must not contain spaces and must not start or end with these characters: `? * ^ $ % # +`
    *   Wherever the string `%s` appears in the bookmark's URL, it will be replaced with any words typed in the address bar after the bookmark's keyword and a space, properly URL-encoded, so they can be used as query string parameters to a search engine, for example.
        *   **Example:** use **`mdn`** as the keyword for the URL [https://developer.mozilla.org/search?q=%s;](https://developer.mozilla.org/search?q=%s;) type **`mdn css border-radius`** in the address bar to test it.
    *   The keyword must not be the same as a [search engine's keyword](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/assign-shortcuts-search-engines). For instance, if a search engine has the keyword **`@g`**, the bookmark's keyword cannot be **`@g`**, but it can be **`g`**.
    *   If the chosen keyword was already assigned to another bookmark, it will be reassigned to the new one.

**Note:** Outside the Library, you can access the keyword field from the context menu by right-clickingholding down the Control key while you click the bookmark and then selecting .

## How do I import bookmarks from another browser or profile?

Firefox lets you import bookmarks from other browsers installed on your computer. It also lets you import other data, such as browsing history and saved passwords, from some of these browsers.
