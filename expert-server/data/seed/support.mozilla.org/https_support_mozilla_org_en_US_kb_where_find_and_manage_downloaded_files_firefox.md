To learn more, see [Manage file types and download actions in Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-firefox-behavior-when-open-file).

For more information, see [Manage file types and download actions in Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-firefox-behavior-when-open-file).

## Download protection

Before beginning a download, Firefox will attempt to protect you from potentially malicious or unsafe downloads, and will block downloads from insecure connections. To learn more, see the Mozilla Security blog posts [Firefox 93 protects against Insecure Downloads](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/10/05/firefox-93-protects-against-insecure-downloads/), [Enhancing Download Protection in Firefox](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2016/08/01/enhancing-download-protection-in-firefox/) and [Improving Malware Detection in Firefox](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2014/07/23/improving-malware-detection-in-firefox/). If something is suspected, the download will not begin, but rather the _Downloads_ panel will display a warning message:

![Fx91UnsafeDownloads](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2022-01-24-06-56-39-c600ee.png)

Potentially malicious downloads are detected using _Google Safe Browsing_ service. The file name will be displayed along with the warning message:

*   _This file contains a virus or malware._

Other files covered under download protection may be potentially unwanted downloads (explained in the [Google Policy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/company/unwanted-software-policy.html)) that may make unexpected changes to your computer. Or, a download may not be malicious or unwanted, but simply not commonly downloaded. The file name will be displayed with one of these warning messages:

*   _This file may harm your computer._
*   _This file is not commonly downloaded._

Download protection is enabled by default in Firefox. For more information, see [How does built-in Phishing and Malware Protection work?](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-does-phishing-and-malware-protection-work)

## How do I handle unsafe downloads?

When you see a malicious file or other types of potentially unsafe files in the _Downloads_ panel, click on the right-facing arrow to choose what to do with the file. You will be given more information about the type of unsafe file and the option to allow the download or remove it:

![Fx98UnsafeDLdetails](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2022-02-23-17-23-14-57c427.png)

**Tip:** The (right-click) context menu includes other options for handling any potentially harmful or malicious files listed in the Downloads panel that are pending download:

![Fx98UnsafeDLcontextmenu](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2022-02-23-17-07-52-d5d996.png)

For example: Right-clickHold down the Control key while you click one of the potentially unsafe files that are pending download and select to save the file to your computer.
