If you use Firefox on multiple devices, a free Mozilla Account lets you sync your history, open tabs, bookmarks and passwords on all your devices. All you need is an email address and password.

## Set up a Mozilla account on your iOS device

1.  At the bottom of the screen, tap the menu button (the menu will be at the top right if you're using an iPad):

2.  Tap to open the _Turn on Sync_ page.
    *   To sign in using QR code pairing:
        *   Visit _[Firefox.com/pair](http://firefox.com/pair)_ on your desktop to show the QR code (you might need to sign in to your Mozilla account first).
        *   When the QR code displays, tap Ready to Scan on your phone.
        *   Scan the QR code on your desktop. Firefox will automatically sign in and sync your information.
    *   To sign in using your email address:
        *   Tap Use Email instead.
        *   Enter your login credentials or sign up for an account (it's free) if you don't have one.
