As you browse the Web, Firefox remembers lots of information for you – sites you've visited, files you've downloaded and more. All of this information is called your history. However, if you are using a public computer or share a computer with someone, you may not want others to see these kinds of things.

This article explains what information is stored in your Firefox history and gives you step-by-step ways to clear all or part of it.

*   To temporarily stop Firefox from storing history, see [Private Browsing - Use Firefox without saving history](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/private-browsing-use-firefox-without-history).

## What information is included in my history?

*   **Browsing & Download History**: Browsing history is the list of sites you've visited that are shown in the History menu, the Library window's History list and the [address bar autocomplete](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/address-bar-autocomplete-firefox) list. Download history is the list of files you've downloaded that are shown in the [Downloads window](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/where-find-and-manage-downloaded-files-firefox).
*   **Form & Search History**: Form history includes the items you've entered into web page forms for [Form autocomplete](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/control-whether-firefox-automatically-fills-forms). Search history includes items you've entered into the search field on the [New Tab page](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-new-tab-page) or into Firefox's [Search bar](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-search-bar-firefox-toolbar).
*   **Cookies**: Websites you visit can store [cookies and other site data](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cookies-information-websites-store-on-your-computer) in your browser, such as login status, site preferences, or task information such as a shopping cart. Cookies can also be used by third parties to track you across sites. See [How do I turn on the Do Not Track feature?](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-turn-do-not-track-feature) to learn more about tracking.
*   **Active Logins**: If you entered a username and password for a site that uses [HTTP basic authentication scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#basic_authentication_scheme) since you last opened Firefox, that login is considered “active”. Clearing this will log you out of all sites that use this authentication method. It will not log you out of websites that use cookies to store login status.
*   **Cache**: The cache stores temporary files, such as web pages and other online media, that Firefox downloaded from the Internet to speed up loading of pages and sites you've already seen. For more information, see [How to clear the Firefox cache](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache).
*   **Offline Website Data**: If you've allowed it, a website can store files on your computer so that you can continue to use it when you are not connected to the Internet. To learn more, see [Manage local site storage settings](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/storage).
*   **Site Preferences**: Site-specific preferences, including the saved [zoom](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/font-size-and-zoom-increase-size-of-web-pages) level for sites, character encoding, and site permissions (like pop-up blocker exceptions) described in the [Firefox Page Info window](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-page-info-window#w_permissions) article.
