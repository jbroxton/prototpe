Add-ons let you add bells and whistles to Firefox. You can get add-ons that compare prices, check the weather, change the look of Firefox, listen to music, or even update your Facebook profile. This article covers the different types of add-ons available and how to find and install them.

## What types of add-ons can I install?

These general types of add-ons can be installed:

*   **[Extensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/extensions/)**  
    Extensions add new features to Firefox or modify existing ones. There are extensions that allow you to block advertisements, download videos from websites, integrate Firefox with websites like e-mail or Facebook, check your grammar and spelling, and so on. Community-created extensions can be found on [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/extensions/).
*   **[Themes](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-themes-change-look-of-firefox)**  
    Themes change the visual appearance of Firefox by setting a custom background image in the browser's header section and the colors used in the tab strip, address bar, menus, and so on. Firefox includes built-in themes and others created by the community can be found on [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/themes/). For more information on built-in themes, see [Built-in themes in Firefox - alternative to complete themes](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/built-themes-firefox-alternative-complete-themes).
*   **Plugins**  
    Firefox automatically downloads and installs the Google Widevine CDM for watching [Digital Rights Management (DRM) controlled content](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-drm) and an [OpenH264 plugin](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/open-h264-plugin-firefox) for video calls.
*   **[Dictionaries](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/language-tools/)**  
    [Firefox can check your spelling](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-use-firefox-spell-checker), but not all locales come with a dictionary installed for licensing reasons. You can [find and install a dictionary](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/language-tools/) for your language.
*   **[Language Packs](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/language-tools)**  
    Language packs change the language of Firefox's user interface. You can [change languages in Firefox's settings menu](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-firefox-another-language) and community-created language packs can be found on [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/language-tools/).
*   **[Search engines](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-your-default-search-settings-firefox)**  
    Firefox comes with a number of search engines already installed. You can access them from the [Search bar (if enabled)](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-search-bar-firefox-toolbar) or directly from the address bar. If you want additional search engines, you can [install them](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-or-remove-search-engine-firefox) on the websites directly or from [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/search-tools/).

## Viewing and managing your installed add-ons

Most types of add-ons can be managed directly from Firefox's Add-on Manager. To access the Add-on Manager:

1.  Click the menu button ![Fx89menuButton](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2021-05-15-11-18-38-e5b736.png) and choose .

For detailed information on disabling or removing add-ons, see [Disable or remove Add-ons](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/disable-or-remove-add-ons).

## How do I find and install add-ons?

Here is an overview to get you started:

1.  Firefox may offer [personalized recommendations](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/personalized-extension-recommendations). Click the menu button ![Fx89menuButton](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2021-05-15-11-18-38-e5b736.png), click and select .
2.  To install a recommended add-on, click the blue \+ Install Theme or \+ Add to Firefox button, depending on the type of add-on.

At the bottom of the list of recommended add-ons, there's also a Find more add-ons button you can click. It will take you to [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/?utm_source=support.mozilla.org&utm_medium=support-article&utm_content=find-and-install-add-ons-add-features-to-firefox) where you can search for specific add-ons.

**For advanced users:** You can also install a signed add-on from a file. When you install an extension from [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/) or a developer's website, Firefox will automatically download and install a file with a .xpi extension. If you save this file to your computer, you can later install the add-on using the gear icon ![Fx91GearIcon](https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/gallery/images/2022-11-22-12-58-07-a6a699.png) in the upper-right area of the Add-ons Manager panel. Select from the menu, then find and select the file.

Once an extension has been installed, you can pin its icon to the toolbar for easy access. See [Manage your extensions using the extensions button in the toolbar](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/extensions-button) for details.
