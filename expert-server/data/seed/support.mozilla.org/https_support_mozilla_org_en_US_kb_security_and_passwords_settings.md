## General

*   **Warn me when sites try to install add-ons**: Firefox will always ask you to confirm installations of add-ons. To prevent unrequested installation prompts which may lead to accidental installations, Firefox warns you when a website tries to install an add-on and blocks the installation prompt. To allow installations from a specific site, click Exceptions…, enter the site name, and click Allow. Uncheck this to disable the warning for all sites.
*   **Block reported attack sites**: Check this if you want Firefox to check whether the site you are visiting may be an attempt to interfere with normal computer functions or send personal data about you to unauthorized parties over the Internet.
    *   Note that the absence of a warning does not guarantee that a site is trustworthy.
*   **Block reported web forgeries**: Check this if you want Firefox to actively check whether the site you are visiting may be an attempt to mislead you into providing personal information (this is often referred to as _phishing_).
    *   Note that the absence of a warning does not guarantee that a site is trustworthy. For more information, see [How does built-in Phishing and Malware Protection work?](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-does-phishing-and-malware-protection-work).

*   **Warn me when sites try to install add-ons**: Firefox will always ask you to confirm installations of add-ons. To prevent unrequested installation prompts which may lead to accidental installations, Firefox warns you when a website tries to install an add-on and blocks the installation prompt. To allow installations from a specific site, click Exceptions…, enter the site name, and click Allow. Uncheck this to disable the warning for all sites.
*   **Block dangerous and deceptive content**: Check this box if you want Firefox to block potential malware or content that can trick you into downloading malware or unintentionally entering information. You can also refine your choices by checking or unchecking the items in this section:
    *   **Block dangerous downloads**: Blocks potential viruses and other malware.
    *   **Warn me about unwanted and uncommon software**: Lets you know if you're about to download potentially unwanted software or uncommon software that may contain a virus or make unexpected changes to your computer.

## Logins

*   **Remember logins for sites**: Firefox can securely save passwords you enter in web forms to make it easier to log on to websites. Clear this checkbox to prevent Firefox from remembering your passwords. See [Password Manager - Remember, delete and edit logins and passwords in Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-edit-logins) for details.
    *   Even with this checked, however, you'll still be asked whether to save passwords for a site when you first visit it. If you select Never for This Site, that site will be added to an exceptions list. To access that list or to remove sites from it, click the Exceptions… button.
*   **Use a master password**: Firefox can protect sensitive information such as saved passwords and certificates by encrypting them using a [master password](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-primary-password-protect-stored-logins). If you create a master password, each time you start Firefox, it will ask you to enter the password the first time it needs to access a certificate or stored password. You can set, change, or remove the master password by checking or unchecking this optionpreference or by clicking the Change Master Password… button. If a master password is already set, you will need to enter it in order to change or remove the master password.
*   You can manage saved passwords and delete individual passwords by clicking the Saved Logins… button.
