What good is that super fast Internet connection when your browser is running at dial-up speed? This article will point you in the right direction to track down and fix the problem. Of course, if you need extra help with any of this, we have a community of volunteers standing by.

**Note:** The [Refresh Firefox feature](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings) can fix many issues by restoring Firefox to its default state while saving your essential information. Consider using it before going through a lengthy troubleshooting process.

## Update Firefox

We're constantly improving Firefox. The latest version is faster than ever before and contains fixes for many problems that could slow down your Firefox. See [Update Firefox to the latest release](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/update-firefox-latest-release) to learn how to update.

## Update your video drivers

Having outdated drivers might slow down performance. See your manufacturer's instructions on how to update your video drivers.

## High hardware resource usage

If a monitoring tool shows you high hardware resource usage, try the suggestions in the [Firefox uses too much memory or CPU resources - How to fix](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-uses-too-much-memory-or-cpu-resources) article.

## Firefox hangs or stops responding

If Firefox freezes and gives you the spinning wheel and turns whitegives you the spinning beach ballturns gray, try the [Firefox hangs or is not responding - How to fix](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-hangs-or-not-responding) article.

## I get a Warning Unresponsive script error

“Unresponsive script error”? What does that even mean? We've got an article about that called, believe it or not, [Warning Unresponsive script - What it means and how to fix it](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/warning-unresponsive-script) that will help clear things up.

## Firefox takes a long time to start up

Try the suggestions in the [Firefox takes a long time to start up](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-takes-long-time-start-up) article.

## Check if you have malware on your computer

To resolve slowness problems not specifically mentioned above, you should scan your computer for viruses, spyware, and other malware and read [Troubleshoot Firefox issues caused by malware](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-firefox-issues-caused-malware).

## Block unneeded content

Content you don't need such as ads or tracking scripts can significantly slow down page loading. Firefox's built-in content-blocking feature can make the pages load faster by preventing third-party trackers from loading. See [Enhanced Tracking Protection in Firefox for desktop](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop) for details.

There are also Firefox add-ons that can block content you don't need, such as:

*   The [Disconnect add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/disconnect/) blocks invisible webpage parts that track you online.
*   The [uBlock Origin add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) blocks ads, trackers and other unneeded content while using less memory and CPU resources than other adblockers.
*   The [NoScript add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/noscript) allows you to selectively enable and disable all scripts running on websites.

Please reach out to the add-on developer directly, if you need help with a specific add-on.
