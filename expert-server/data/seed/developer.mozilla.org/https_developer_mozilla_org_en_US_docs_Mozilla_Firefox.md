## [Firefox channels](#firefox_channels)

Firefox is available in five **channels**.

### [Firefox Nightly](#firefox_nightly)

Each night we build Firefox from the latest code in [mozilla-central](https://hg-edge.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/). These builds are for Firefox developers or those who want to try out the very latest cutting-edge features while they're still under active development.

### [Firefox Developer Edition](#firefox_developer_edition)

This is a version of Firefox tailored for developers. Firefox Developer Edition has all the latest developer tools that have reached beta. We also add some extra features for developers that are only available in this channel. It uses its own path and profile, so that you can run it alongside Release or Beta Firefox.

### [Firefox Beta](#firefox_beta)

Every four weeks, we take the features that are stable enough, and create a new version of Firefox Beta. Firefox Beta builds are for Firefox enthusiasts to test what's destined to become the next released Firefox version.

After stabilizing for another four weeks in Beta, we're ready to ship the new features to hundreds of millions of users in a new release version of Firefox.
