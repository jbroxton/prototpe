## About Speqq

**Speqq** is a requirements management tool designed for Product Managers to:
- Organize and structure product requirements
- Track requirement status and progress
- Collaborate with engineering teams
- Maintain clear documentation and traceability
- Streamline the product development workflow

This MVP will be used for:
- **Product demos** to potential customers
- **Investor presentations** showcasing the platform
- **User testing** with real Product Managers
- **Marketing materials** and website screenshots

---

## Core Principles

### OSS-Only Development
- **NEVER write custom code** - we are an OSS shop
- Use the best open source libraries that fit the requirements
- Follow all SDK documentation exactly as written
- Justify every library choice with clear reasoning

### NextJS & TypeScript Maximization
- **Use every available NextJS feature**: App Router, Server Components, Server Actions, built-in optimizations
- **Use every available TypeScript feature**: Strict mode, advanced types, generics, utility types, branded types
- Leverage the full power of both platforms

### Quality Standards
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write failing Jest tests first, then make them pass
- **Production-ready code**: Every line must be investor-demo quality
- **Clean architecture**: Simple, modular, readable, and maintainable
- **Professional UI**: Modern, clean design using Shadcn/ui components

---

## Development Workflow

**MANDATORY:** Follow `docs/development-process` for all work:

1. **Stage 1:** Project Initiation
2. **Stage 2:** Overview Draft & Approval  
3. **Stage 3:** User Stories & Acceptance Criteria
4. **Stage 4:** Test-Driven Development
5. **Stage 5:** Design Document
6. **Stage 6:** Implementation & Completion

**Role-Specific Behavior:**
- **Engineers:** Follow `docs/Role/engineer.md` exactly
- **Engineering Managers:** Follow `docs/Role/eng-manager.md` exactly

---

## Technical Stack

### Required Technologies
- **Framework:** NextJS (latest) with App Router
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Testing:** Jest for all tests
- **UI Components:** Shadcn/ui components exclusively
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

### Code Quality Requirements
- **Zero custom code** - OSS libraries only
- **Zero `any` types** without explicit justification
- **Functions under 20 lines** (excluding imports/exports)
- **Components under 100 lines** with single responsibility
- **No nesting deeper than 3 levels**
- **No duplicate code blocks**
- **No unused imports or dead code**

---

## Product Manager Focus

Since Speqq serves Product Managers, ensure all features:
- **Solve real PM pain points** in requirements management
- **Streamline workflows** for requirement organization and tracking
- **Provide clear visibility** into requirement status and progress
- **Enable collaboration** between PMs and engineering teams
- **Maintain traceability** from requirements to implementation

---

## Success Criteria

A feature is complete ONLY when:
- All Acceptance Criteria pass their tests
- Code meets all quality standards (see development process)
- UI is professional and investor-ready
- Feature actually helps Product Managers manage requirements better
- Documentation is complete and accurate

---

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)

- Don't write custom code - use existing OSS solutions
- Don't skip the development process stages
- Don't create files unnecessarily - update existing ones
- Don't use vague typing or leave dead code
- Don't over-engineer - keep it simple and focused
- Don't produce placeholder or untested code
- Don't ignore the role-specific behavior documents

---

## Remember

You're building a **professional requirements management tool** that Product Managers will use to organize their work. Every feature should make their job easier, every interface should be intuitive, and every interaction should feel polished and reliable.

**This is investor-demo quality software** - code and design accordingly.
